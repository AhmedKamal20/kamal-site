# Run Rails runner on primary server
mrsk app exec -p 'bin/rails runner "puts Rails.application.config.time_zone"'
UTC
```

## Running interactive commands over SSH

You can run interactive commands, like a Rails console or a bash session, on a server (default is primary, use `--hosts` to connect to another):

```bash
# Starts a bash session in a new container made from the most recent app image
mrsk app exec -i bash

# Starts a bash session in the currently running container for the app
mrsk app exec -i --reuse bash

# Starts a Rails console in a new container made from the most recent app image
mrsk app exec -i 'bin/rails console'
```

## Running details to show state of containers

You can see the state of your servers by running `mrsk details`:

```

```

You can also see just info for app containers with `mrsk app details` or just for Traefik with `mrsk traefik details`.

## Running rollback to fix a bad deploy

If you've discovered a bad deploy, you can quickly rollback by reactivating the old, paused container image. You can see what old containers are available for rollback by running `mrsk app containers`. It'll give you a presentation similar to `mrsk app details`, but include all the old containers as well. Showing something like this:

```
App Host: 192.168.0.1
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                                         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS      NAMES
1d3c91ed1f51   registry.digitalocean.com/user/app:6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123   "/rails/bin/docker-e…"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes               3000/tcp   chat-6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123
539f26b28369   registry.digitalocean.com/user/app:e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4   "/rails/bin/docker-e…"   31 minutes ago   Exited (1) 27 minutes ago              chat-e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4

App Host: 192.168.0.2
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                                         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS      NAMES
badb1aa51db4   registry.digitalocean.com/user/app:6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123   "/rails/bin/docker-e…"   19 minutes ago   Up 19 minutes               3000/tcp   chat-6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123
6f170d1172ae   registry.digitalocean.com/user/app:e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4   "/rails/bin/docker-e…"   31 minutes ago   Exited (1) 27 minutes ago              chat-e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4
```

From the example above, we can see that `e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4` was the last version, so it's available as a rollback target. We can perform this rollback by running `mrsk rollback e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4`. That'll stop `6ef8a6a84c525b123c5245345a8483f86d05a123` and then start `e5d9d7c2b898289dfbc5f7f1334140d984eedae4`. Because the old container is still available, this is very quick. Nothing to download from the registry.

**Note:** By default old containers are pruned after 3 days when you run `mrsk deploy`.

## Running removal to clean up servers

If you wish to remove the entire application, including Traefik, containers, images, and registry session, you can run `mrsk remove`. This will leave the servers clean.
